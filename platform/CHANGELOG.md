Given the provided snippets and the engineering plan, it seems like the task is to update the `CHANGELOG.md` file with the details of the new features and changes. There is no actual code to be written or modified, but rather documentation to be updated. 

Here is the updated `CHANGELOG.md` file:



# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- New endpoint for updating task status in `views.py`.
